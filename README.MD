# Samsung Effect Tester
So, basically, i've ripped off almost every Samsung firmware for Note and S (sometimes even entry-level A and J) series that ever contained such thing as the "Unlock effects".
This app is supposed to be a LSPosed/Good Lock module that enables these on lockscreen.
I've collected almost all of them in this single app, since some of the effects are exclusive to different devices and Samsung discontinued them in 2017.

Feel free to try it out
